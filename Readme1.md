Project Title: MME: Money Made Easy

This was a group Project for the course CSE3002- Internet and Web Programming.
Created by: Debargha Guha Neogi, Ansh Chandarana and Harshvardhan Mishra.

This is a payments service, targeted at users in colleges and universities. In this website, activities start with MME automating a customer account, which allows personnel to create, update and maintain customer records.

We have used HTML5, CSS3 and JS in FrontEnd.
We have used PHP, MySQL for BackEnd and Database respectively.
We worked on Xampp server for demo
We have not included the database file as it had some sensitive information like our personal and college email addresses which was used to send OTP.

How to Setup OTP/ Email Services in Xampp?
Answer: You have to do certain changes in Xampp's php.ini file in php folder, sendmail.ini file in sendmail folder and have to set up Mercury's SMTP Server properly to get your email services underway.
